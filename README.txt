R code I have written for the analysis
of MALDI imaging peaklist data is in 
localFunctions.R, I want to get around 
to wrapping it properly into a package
at some point.

tute.Rnw provides both:
 - a simple example of the use of knitr
     to produce a nicely formatted and
     reproducible LaTeX document, 
     including bibtex referencing.
 - a step-by-step explanation of how to 
     use most of the code in 
     localFunctions.R
